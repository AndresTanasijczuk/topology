Description: The formation path way for the compact habitable zone planets system
  TOI-700 composed of 4 planets is still a mystery. We use N-body simulations with
  Mercury hybrid integrator to explore how this system was formed. Specifically, we
  explore the possibility that the TOI-700 system started as a chain of planets in
  mean-motion-resonance, and was then destabilized after the gas disk dissipated.
