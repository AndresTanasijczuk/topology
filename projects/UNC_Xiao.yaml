Description: In the wild, animal groups such as fish schools and sheep herds exhibit
  collective motion behavior during foraging, predator evasion and migration. The
  mechanism for how individual sensory input is propagated through the modular groups
  to result in emergent behavior is elusive. We use a 2D self-propelled particle model
  that incorporates animal-like topological social alignment interaction as well as
  informed individuals with access to environmental cues. We investigate the effect
  of the self-organized cluster structure on how informed individuals transmit information.
  We aim to determine the order of phase transition in global polarization and local
  structure, as informedness permeates the group.
