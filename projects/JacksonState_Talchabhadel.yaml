Description: research focuses on the interconnected impacts of climate change, flooding,
  and heatwaves. We employ both physically-based and data-driven models to analyze
  these phenomena. Our physically-based approach utilizes advanced climate and hydrological
  simulations to project future scenarios, while our data-driven methodology leverages
  machine learning and statistical techniques to identify patterns in large-scale
  climate datasets.
