Description: We use imaging of planarian behavioral responses to evaluate effects
  on neuronal function and neurodevelopment/regeneration. Our projects span from understanding
  the neuroethology of different behaviors to using planarians as a screening platform
  for different chemicals, to understand both neuroefficacy and toxicology.
