  My students and I are planetary scientists who study the planets,
  moons, asteroids, and comets of the Solar System as well as other
  planetary systems with computational tools from the fields of
  celestial mechanics, geophysics, and geochemistry.  Our science is
  driven by big questions: where did our world come from? What other
  kinds of worlds are out there? And, how unique is our planets
  history? (www.planetarymakerspace.org)
