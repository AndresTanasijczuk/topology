Description: The research is exploring the use of text classification algorithms to
  identify and mitigate inappropriate behavior in Twitch micro-communities, with a
  focus on developing more nuanced and context-aware moderation tools. By combining
  linguistic analysis with Social Identity theory, the study aims to create dynamic,
  community specific language models that can adapt to the unique norms and linguistic
  patterns of different online groups.
