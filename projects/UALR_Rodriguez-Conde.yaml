Description: Social media platforms have changed how information is shared and how
  communities interact. Among these platforms, Reddit stands out as a major hub for
  discussions, helping to form and grow niche communities. This project aims to explore
  the evolution of the computer vision community on Reddit by using advanced methods
  to understand how people engage, share knowledge, and collectively develop an understanding
  of computer vision over time.
