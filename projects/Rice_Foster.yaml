Description: Working on the interlay of correlated order and spatially rarified wave
  functions indued by spatial inhomogeneities in condensed matter systems. We have
  shown that the superconductivity can be enhanced in quasiperiodic twisted bilayer
  graphene with a preprint (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.06676). Currently
  we are focused on quasiperiodic twisted trilayers, where the physics is much richer
  and our results have a closer relation with experiments.
