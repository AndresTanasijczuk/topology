Description: 'My research broadly focuses on (a) causal inference under interference
  and non-i.i.d. settings, (b) causal inference under unmeasured confounding, and
  (c) optimal treatment regimes and policy learning. A common theme in my research
  is to use non/semiparametric theory and optimization methods to develop efficient
  and robust estimators of causal quantities in (a)-(c).
