Description: >-
    The EHT project combines data from several very-long-baseline
    interferometry (VLBI) stations around Earth, which form a combined array
    with an angular resolution sufficient to observe objects the size of
    a supermassive black hole's event horizon. The project's observational
    targets include the two black holes with the largest angular diameter as
    observed from Earth: the black hole at the center of the supergiant
    elliptical galaxy Messier 87, and Sagittarius A*, at the center of the
    Milky Way.
