Description: 'Work in the interdisciplinary fields in theoretical condensed matter
  physics, quantum information science and statistical physics. My research focuses
  on non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-particle systems, especially open quantum
  systems and disordered systems. My "Quantum Dynamics and Information" group at LSU
  will focus on three integrated research areas: (1) entanglement dynamics in monitored
  quantum circuits, (2) manipulation of quantum material by light and (3) dynamics
  of disordered systems and thermalization.'
