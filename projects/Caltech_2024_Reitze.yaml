Description: The mission of the U.S. National Science Foundation Laser Interferometer
  Gravitational-wave Observatory is to open the field of gravitational-wave astrophysics
  through the direct detection of gravitational waves. LIGO is a national facility
  for gravitational-wave research, providing opportunities for the broader scientific
  community to participate in detector development, observations and data analysis.
  LIGO detectors are available for use by members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration
  (LSC), comprising researchers in partner institutions around the world.
