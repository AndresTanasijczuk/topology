  The World Ocean Database (WOD) is the world''s largest collection of uniformly formatted,
  quality controlled, publicly available ocean profile data. It is a powerful tool
  for oceanographic, climatic, and environmental research, and the end result of more
  than 20 years of coordinated efforts to incorporate data from institutions, agencies,
  individual researchers, and data recovery initiatives into a single database. WOD
  data spans from Captain Cook''s 1772 voyage to the contemporary Argo period, making
  it a valuable resource for long term and historical ocean climate analysis. Original
  versions of the 20,000+ datasets in the WOD are available'
