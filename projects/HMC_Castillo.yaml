Description: "My group uses spectroscopy to understand intermolecular interactions;\
  \ that is, the way two molecules \u201Ctouch\u201D one another. These interactions\
  \ are of importance in understanding a wide range of chemically relevant processes,\
  \ including solvation effects, molecular recognition, and molecular aggregation.\
  \ To characterize these interactions, we record ground and excited state spectra\
  \ in the gas phase. We then use quantum chemical calculations and computational\
  \ simulations to understand our spectra."
