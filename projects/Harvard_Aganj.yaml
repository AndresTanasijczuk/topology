Description: "https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/11026499\nUsing magnetic resonance\
  \ imaging techniques, we will define both vulnerable and resilient brain networks\
  \ involved in aging, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and\
  \ uncover new imaging biomarkers to improve diagnosis and treatment. Normal aging,\
  \ as well as occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases, can be better understood\
  \ by mapping complex structural and functional brain networks through which information\
  \ flows, and via the discovery of important biomarkers that shed light on aging\
  \ and neurodegenerative disease."
