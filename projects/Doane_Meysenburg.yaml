Description: This fall, I'm teaching a seminar for undergraduate students participating
  in the "Developing Computational Efficacy and Skill Within an Inclusive Community
  of Practice in the Natural Sciences" NSF grant, award number 2142238. In the grant,
  we teach natural science students coding skills through Python image processing.
  A central part of the seminar is to teach the students how to improve the performance
  of their Python code. As a capstone to that portion of the class, students will
  use OSG Services.
