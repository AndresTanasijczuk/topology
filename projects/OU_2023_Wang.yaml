Department: School of Sustainable Chemical, Biological, and Materials Engineering
Description: This project is focused on computational simulations of materials chemistry, physics and engineering with an emphasis on nanoscale materials, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, we are interested in advanced energy materials and their applications in catalysis, molecular sensors, and energy conversion.
