Description: I am a theorist working on the intersection of condensed matter physics
  and quantum information science. My recent focus is many-body quantum dynamics,
  quantum error correction, and topological phases. My research uses both analytical
  methods and numerical tools such as tensor networks, Monte Carlo simulation, and
  Clifford simulation. Here is a link to my Google scholar profile.
