Description: The project focuses on machine learning (ML)-aided design of antimicrobial
  peptides (AMP), viable therapeutic alternative to antibiotics. It builds upon an
  existing workflow that interrogates a database via API queries, creates suitable
  libraries, predicts AMP 3D structures through MC or MD simulations, and extract
  structure-based features (SbF).
