Description: The Floability project (NSF CSSI 2411436) is developing techniques for
  creating reliable, scalable, and reproducible workflows that can be accessed through
  computational notebooks.  Here, we are adapting atmospheric analysis codes using
  the Dask framework to use Dask + TaskVine so as to run effectively on preemptible
  resources on the OSG.  This is a limited development and testing activity -- if
  successful, the codes will be passed to end users for production runs.
