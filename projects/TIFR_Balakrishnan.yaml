Description: Large scale Monte Carlo simulations for interpretation of experimental
  cosmic ray data. CORSIKA is one such cosmic ray simulation package widely used among
  the cosmic ray community for studying the extensive air shower development in the
  Earth's atmosphere under various simulation world conditions. Subsequently, the
  simulated cosmic ray secondaries are processed with detector simulation tools for
  generating measurable physical quantities that can be compared with experiment.
  These procedures are important for improving the current understanding of cosmic
  ray modulation in the interplanetary space and solar storms. These studies have
  potential impact in space-weather studies that can directly benefit the society.
