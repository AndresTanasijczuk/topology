Description: We will be using the OSPool to assist with the creation of radiative
  transfer models of heterogeneous terrestrial exoplanets that incorporate diurnal
  rotation and seasonal variability. Spectra will be generated over the visible to
  near-infrared wavelengths and cover all major planetary phase angles.
